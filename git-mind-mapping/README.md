# Git And Mind Mapping
A hypothesis for why to use Git (or any VCS) for mind mapping

## What is Mind Mapping
According to www.mindmapping.com:
```
Mind mapping is a highly effective way of getting information in and out of your brain. Mind mapping is a creative and logical means of note-taking and note-making that literally "maps out" your ideas.
```

For my specific purpose, I will further describe mind mapping as generally capture my own thoughts and ideas over time and evolving them.

## Why use Git
I realized that I use Git and am far more comfortable with a filesystem / directory approach to capturing and managing my thoughts over using other software solutions such as Wordpress or Drupal. Furthermore, using Git gives me the benefit of freely uploading code snippets and other documentation in a way that I am more comfortable with than other solutions. Best yet, using Github provides an easily accesiblee and open platform for other's to view this project, comment on it, suggest on it and follow if they so choose. Other people could even fork this project if it interested them enough

## Github and Mind-Mapping Analogs
How I plan to utilize the mechanics of Github for Mindmapping

### Repository
The repository will act as a demonstration of the evolution of the mind overtime

At the top level of the repository's folder structure will be idea folders. Idea folders will contain their own README.md files, describing the purpose of the folder and references to subdirectories within the folder.

It is the role of the README.md to reference any other relevant idea folders.

### Branches
 * **MASTER** - The most latest and fleshed out ideas
 * **THOUGHTS/\*\*** - New ideation

### Pull Requests
If people have major disagreements with my thoughts and ideas, they can submit commentary or revisions in the form of pull requests. This represents the literal conflict and accepting of other's ideas as my own
