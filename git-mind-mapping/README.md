Git And Mind Mapping Theory

**Repository**
The repository will act as a demonstration of the evolution of the mind overtime

At the top level of the repository's folder structure will be idea folders. Idea folders will contain their own README.md files, describing the purpose of the folder and references to subdirectories within the folder.

It is the role of the README.md to reference any other relevant idea folders.

**Branches**
 - master
        The most latest and fleshed out ideas
 - thought branches (thoughts/**)
        New ideation
